# BinasTI
Biology, Physics and Chemistry resources on the TI-84 Plus family of calculators.

## Important notice about TI Basic limitations
TI Basic has some annoying limitations, like the limited amount of values you can assign to different labels. For this reason, please submit your contribution as a seperate program if it adds new tables to the program. After we got enough tables, we'll split the program into modules to make it more 'digestuable' for the TI Basic.

## How do I install this onto my calculator?
1. Download the newest release of BiNaS.
2. Install the [TI Connect™ CE](https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw) software for the TI-84 Plus family of calculators. It's available on Windows, macOS and Linux.
3. Connect your calculator to the computer using the cable that came packaged.
4. Open the Calculator Explorer inside of the TI Connect™ CE software. Here you'll see which packages are currently installed. This is also where you can uninstall packages, including the one you're about to install, as well.
5. Drag-and-drop BINAS.8xp from your File Explorer into the TI Connect™ CE window. Now, follow the on-screen instructions to complete your installation.

## Languages & Translations
Currently, this project is only available in Dutch and English. Because these languages are maintained seperately, one version might have more features or get bug fixes early. We currently don't accept translations into other languages for this repository, but we may do so in the future. Meanwhile, feel free to copy the source code and translate it yourself for distribution on your own repository.
